# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - Vectors are just x,y,z values.
  - Json in string format can be pretty printed.
  - Snippets can be created and used in VSCode.
  - `[[` is also a process/ command. (also known as `test`)
  - Files can be linked.
  - Notifications can be generated by us too.
  - Can store output of a command in a variable.

- What changed in your understanding?
  - Vectors are not complex numbers. (I was thinking till today.)
  - if is not what checks the condition in shell script.

- What would you explain differently now?
  - If command just checks if the previous command is successful. The
    `[[`(previous command - executed before the if) returns status code based on
    the condition evaluation.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - Why did Jayanth translate? Can't he just give the value from the initial
    origin?

- What would you like to see one more example of?
  - translating.

- What feels fragile in your understanding?
  - The lack of basic math knowledge feels fragile.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- What does `z` does in a vector?
- What is a unit vector? How is it different from normal vector?
- What is terminal velocity?
- How to use apple script using Javascript and Shell Script?
- What status code does `deno test` returns on passing and failing cases?

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- Make a shell script which runs deno tests and uses `say` command to notify if
  all tests are passed or not.
- Make a shell function which will create a ready to use `_test.js` file.
- Make an apple script to call out if I am coding for more than 30 minutes.
- Make an apple script which will remind me to write `til` every evening.
- Try to make a small and simple bank transaction system on shell.
- Simulate basic shapes and animations in `P5.js`.
- Simulate rain in `P5.js`.
- Make a script which will use the today's created file by date and commit. So
  no mistake will happen.
