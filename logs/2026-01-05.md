# Today I Learned

- Our day to day life is not totally random.
- Input devices are also files just like stdin and stdout.

---

# Still Confusing

- Why stdin and stdout are expiring after single use?
- What is a stream? Is it just a flow of data? (Having issue in making a mental
  model)
- What is a buffer? Just a place to store data?

---

# Questions to Chase

- Why can't we use same process stdin and stdout after single use?
- What are async generators?
- Will there be different buffers for stdin, stdout and stderr?
- What is meant by lock and locked in stream classes?

---

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

- Use the controlled randomness to plot our batch ages (19 - 22).
- Implement my own grep using stdin and stdout.
- Implement readable for single character (like read the readable buffer length
  if is more than one, make some error or something [need to know more about it]
  and stop reading from stdin and then just read the character in the buffer)

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because **I have learnt about the what a proper random should
> be like, learnt about interacting with streams**.
